BFS(graph,source):

- Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
- mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source)
- while the queue is not empty:
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all adjacent nodes of "head":
         - if visited[adj_node] == 0:
            - visited[adj_node] = 1 and q.push(adj_node)
