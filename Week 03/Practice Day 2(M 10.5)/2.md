# 2. Oftentimes we are interested in finding the path from the source node to the destination node in a graph. Can you briefly describe how we can do that when we are using BFS or DFS? 
```
Sure! Both BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first search) are algorithms commonly used for traversing a graph, and can also be used to find the path from a source node to a destination node.

When using BFS, we start at the source node and explore its neighbors first, then the neighbors' neighbors, and so on, until we find the destination node. To keep track of the path, we can use a dictionary or an array to store the parent of each visited node. In other words, we store the node from which we discovered each neighbor. Once we find the destination node, we can backtrack from the destination node to the source node by following the parent pointers we stored earlier. This will give us the path from the source to the destination.

When using DFS, we also start at the source node and explore as deep as possible along each branch, backtracking only when necessary. To keep track of the path, we can use a stack or recursion to store the path we have explored so far. Once we find the destination node, we can return the path that led us to it. However, DFS does not necessarily give us the shortest path, and we may need to modify the algorithm or use another approach to ensure we find the shortest path.

Both BFS and DFS have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific problem and graph structure. BFS is typically used when we want to find the shortest path or explore all nodes within a certain distance of the source, while DFS is typically used when we want to explore the graph deeply or when memory usage is a concern.
