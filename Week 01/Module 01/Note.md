# Algorithms
```
In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers: 

1. Take two number inputs
2. Add numbers using the + operator
3. Display the result
```

# Graphs
```
A graph is a unique data structure in programming that consists of finite sets of nodes or vertices and a set of edges that connect these vertices to them. At this moment, adjacent vertices can be called those vertices that are connected to the same edge with each other.

# Node(Vertics) And Edge
```
1. Node: A Node is a visual representation of an entity.
2. Edge: An Edge is a visual representation of a relation.  It is a line that connects two nodes.
```

# Variations Of Grapsh 
1. **Weighted graph:** 
```
A graph having value or weight of vertices. 
```

2. **Unweighted graph:** 
```
A graph having no value or weight of vertices.
```

3. **Directed graph:** 
```
A graph having a direction indicator.
```

4. **Undirected graph:**
```
A graph where no directions are defined.
```

5. **Bipartite Graph:** 
```
A bipartite graph also called a bi-graph, is a set of graph vertices, i.e, points where multiple lines meet, decomposed into two disjoint sets, meaning they have no element in common, such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
```

6. **Complete Graph:** 
```
A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge.
If Complete graph has n Node and it's Edge is n*(n-1)/2.
```

7. **Trees:** 
```
Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.Tree has no cycle and each node connected by edges and unique path between two nodes.
If Tree has n node and it's Edge is (n-1).
```

8. **Rooted Tree:** 
```
A rooted tree is a tree with a special vertex labelled as the "root" of the tree.
```

9. **Unrooted Tree:** 
```
A free tree or unrooted tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. 
```

# Multi Edge and Self Loop
```
1. Multi Edge: Multiple edges are two or more edges connecting the same two vertices within a multigraph.
2. Self Loop:  It is the edges that are connected from a vertex to itself.
```
