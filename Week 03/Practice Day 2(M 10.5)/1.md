# 1. Can we solve the Single Source Shortest Path Problem with DFS? Why or why not? What if the graph is a DAG, can we solve it then? (Code is not required)


### Can we solve the Single Source Shortest Path Problem with DFS?
```
DFS (Depth First Search) is not an appropriate algorithm for solving the Single Source Shortest Path problem. The reason for this is that DFS does not guarantee that it will find the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in the graph.
```

### Why or why not?
```
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In other words, DFS is designed to traverse the graph in a depth-first manner, rather than finding the shortest path.
```

### What if the graph is a DAG, can we solve it then?
```
However, if the graph is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), we can solve the Single Source Shortest Path problem using a modified DFS algorithm. In a DAG, we can use topological sorting to order the nodes in a linear fashion so that we can traverse the graph in a specific order. We can then use a modified version of DFS to compute the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in the graph.

The modified DFS algorithm for DAGs is called the DAG Shortest Path algorithm, which works as follows:

1. Topologically sort the nodes in the graph.
2. Initialize the distances from the source node to all other nodes to infinity, except for the source node itself, which is set to zero.
3. For each node in the topologically sorted order, update the distances of all its neighbors based on the distance to the current node plus the weight of the edge between them.
4. The final distances from the source node to all other nodes will be stored in the distance array.

Therefore, while DFS cannot solve the Single Source Shortest Path problem in a general graph, it can solve it in a DAG.
